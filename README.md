## Project Overview

This Contionous Assessment is part of my Advanced JavaScript assignment to develop a REST API of my choice. I have chose to do a Youtube Video API as it allows for the expandability and the complexity of relationships and functionalities of this case study.

In order to utilise my API to its utmost capacibilities. I have documented the basics API calls using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) and examples of the resulting data you could expect when fetching through my API. 

### **You can access an online version of this assignment on: https://aj-ca-1.vercel.app/ ** ###

**But in order to access the documentation itself** you must use: 

- ### ```npm install``` 

This will install the nescessarily dependencies to run Swagger. Then to access my documentation, <br/>
you can do so with ```{your domain}/```

And when you have everything set up and run the server and access the site, it should return something like this:
